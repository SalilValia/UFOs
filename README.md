# UFOs
 JavaScript module 

## Overview 
The purpose of this assignment was to procide an analysis of UFO sightings around the world by allowing users to filter through the UFO sighting data through city, state, country, and shape. 

## Results 
Upon opening up the web page, you'll notice the search criteria is blank. The 5 search categories were mentioned in the summar. 
1. Enter Date
2. Enter a City
3. Enter a State 
4. Enter a Country
5. Enter a Shape. 

Each of these criteria has an example of what data it is looking for. When you type in a criteria and press enter it'll pull the data and update the table to the criteria you have requested. For example, I decided to type in 'ny' in the state category to pull UFO sightings that occured in the State of New York. After hitting enter the table changed and we can see that there was 4 sightings in the state of new york.

Now lets filter it even more and say we are looking for a UFO sighting in the state of New york but had the shape of the a 'light' we can keep NY in the category search and also add light in the shape search. The table will then narrow down and pull info for the exact sighting you are looking for.

Another example. But first clear out the search categories to reset the the data table. From noticing the table I've noticed the city 'el cajon' had a few sightings. So in the city category we will type in 'el cajon' and the table will be filtered to all the sightings that happened in that city. After hitting enter we noticed that five sightings happened in that city. Now if you want to filter it again to let sightings in el cajon with only light shapes, then simply type in light in the shape cateogry and the table will be norrowed to only two.

## Summary
One drawback I noticed is that you need to correctly type in the entries in the categories in order to filter the tables. For Example, if I had captialized the state 'ny' to 'NY' the table will not be filtered and will pull in no results. This is becuase the search criteria must match exactly how it is shown in the data. 

Recommendations

One recommendation is that I would suggest adding a search category for 'duration' to show how long each encounter/sighting took place. it seems to be more useful than the coutry category as it seems majority of the sightings happened in the U.S. 

A second recommendation would be to insert and highlights back to which search functions we are currently using so the user does not get confused. I also reccomeend adding a map feature to show a visual image of sightings that occured connected with the date category to show if there was multiple cities that had a sighting at a certain time to determine if the cities were seeing the same sighting but at a differnt viewpoint/angle.
