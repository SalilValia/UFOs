## Summary 
The purpose of this assignment was to procide an analysis of UFO sightings around the world by allowing users to filter through the UFO sighting data through city, state, country, and shape. 

## Results 
Upon opening up the web page, you'll notice the search criteria is blank. The 5 search categories were mentioned in the summar. 
1. Enter Date
2. Enter a City
3. Enter a State 
4. Enter a Country
5. Enter a Shape. 

Each of these criteria has an example of what data it is looking for. When you type in a criteria and press enter it'll pull the data and update the table to the criteria you have requested. For example, I decided to type in 'ny' in the state category to pull UFO sightings that occured in the State of New York. After hitting enter the table changed and we can see that there was 4 sightings in the state of new york.

Now lets filter it even more and say we are looking for a UFO sighting in the state of New york but had the shape of the a 'light' we can keep NY in the category search and also add light in the shape search. The table will then narrow down and pull info for the exact sighting you are looking for.
